## About Project

In this project, we will build an awesome to-do list app in ReactJS, with the data stored in the back end, specifically in a Firebase Firestore database. The hosting will also
be in Firebase. The data for the app was stored in a Firebase Firestore database, and it even has delete functionality.

We will show how to use Material UI for the icons in the project, and we will be using a useRef hook in this project. The example image shows what the app will look like. The user will be able to enter a to-do item and store it in a lovely list in the firebase database. So, this list is permanent and wonâ€™t be changed after a refresh of browser.
